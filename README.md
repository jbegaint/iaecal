# IAECal 

Use a web application as a workaround to get a google calendar compatible link 
(ics format) from a FullCalendar JSON events source (requiring authentication).

Build with [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), 
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) and 
[icalendar](https://github.com/collective/icalendar/).
